# FRDM-K82F

Soft Real Time O.S. with Non-Preemptive First Come First Served Task Scheduling, Preemptive Prioritized Interrupt, "Educational" Project - NXP ARM Cortex M4F

Test some basic functionality for NXP K82F in FRDM board, without libraries.

ATTENTION!! There are many inconsistencies with K82F data sheet to set preemptive priority !! ... this code seems to work well !!

    PIT: interrupt with "high" pre-emptive priority (1), time for delay and state machine, increment internal counter every about 1 ms;
    
    I2S: serial sinc-communication with with PCM1808 24 bit - 44100 Hz (96 kHz is also possible...) audio ADC and UDA1334ATS 24bit audio DAC connected to a small power integrated audio stereo amplifier with 2 nearly full-range speaker at it's end (really range is 180 Hz to 5 KHz... but is good to prove this example). 
    
    MAIN: just once, play the 12 musical note in 4Â° octave, blink led every 1 s in task0, and, for now, nothing to do in task 1 (working on QSPI FLASH) and 2. In task3, receive audio data from PCM1808 ADC and send it to UDA1334 DAC, first time in flat, after appling FIR low pass  filter in sequence of: 400Hz - 800 Hz - 2 kHz.
